*A terminal-based window manager. Developed all the way back in 2018 and uploaded here for archival purposes. Expect bad quality. Cool concept, though.*

zWM is a lightweight window manager that you can run in the terminal while using things such as SSH sessions.

Currently, as the project is in alpha, installation instructions have not yet been put together. If you know a bit of Python, it's probably not too hard to figure out. If not, eh, maybe I'll add instructions later. This isn't exactly actively maintained.
